##  [CSC722: Advanced Topics in Machine Learning Project] Recipe Recommendation System
# Requirements:
- **Python 3.7**: This project assumes that dictionaries have some notion of consistent ordering. By default, 3.7 makes this assumption. Otherwise, dictionaries should be changed to OrderedDict.
- **TO DEMO:**
>> 1. Download recipe_info.csv, recipes_encoded100.csv, and recipes_normalized_varFS_extraTrees186.csv from the Google Drive link below
>> 2. Put the csv files in a folder named "Data" in your local copy of this repository.
>> 3. Run recipe_rate_gui.py and select the type of data-cluster combination desired. Bon Appetit!
# Project Goal: 
Data-driven recipe recommendation system using web-scraped recipe data (including but not limited to data like ingredients, health facts, etc.) and user’s historical preference.
# Motivation:
Cooking is a hobby for some and a major problem for others. However, you can always use a helping hand for cooking. Being a student, it is always a difficult decision to decide what to eat for lunch or dinner. Sometimes faced with limited items in the kitchen, it is always a challenge to decide what to cook for meal. This inspired us to create a system that can recommend recipes based on ingredient suggestions.
# Data:
All data is stored on a Google Drive at https://tinyurl.com/yajzjchs.
We scraped a total of **61,880** recipes, and parsed the set of ingredients to produce a set of unique ingredients. We then passed these unique ingredients through a unit conversion pipeline, resulting in a total of 37,765 ingredient features (each ingredient has a 'mass' feature and a 'volume' feature). Due to the dimensionality issues, we have processed the data several times using feature selection, and we have uploaded the smaller representations.
- **recipe_info.csv**: the recipe 'name', 'type' (e.g., Breakfast and Brunch), and 'subtype' (e.g., Pancake Recipes). Also contains a column for each GMM-produced cluster labels. For each of the feature-reduced datasets, there are cluster results for 4, 25, and 54 components.
- **recipes_normalized_varFS.csv**: the set of ingredients, normalized, for all recipes. There are a total of 7,580 features in this processed set after performing Variance Threshold feature selection, using the mean normalized variance for all features.
- **recipes_normalized_varFS_incrementalPCA100.csv**: set of ingredients transformed to a size of (61880, 100) by using incremental PCA in batches of 100.
- **recipes_normalized_varFS_incrementalPCA1000.csv**: set of ingredients transformed to a size of (61880, 1000) by using incremental PCA in batches of 1000.
- **recipes_normalized_varFS_extraTrees912.csv**: set of ingredients chosen by ensemble classifier (classifying subtype) with a size of (61880, 912)
- **recipes_normalized_varFS_extraTrees186.csv**: set of ingredients chosen again (from previously derived set) by an identical ensemble classifier, with a size of (61880, 186)
- **recipes_encoded100.csv**: recipe dimensions were reduced from 7000+ to 100 using a stacked autoencoder of hidden layers 1000 and 100. Input Set: recipes_normalized_varFS.csv. Output Size: (61880, 100)
- **recipes_encoded1000.csv**: recipe dimensions were reduced from 7000+ to 1000 using a one-hidden-layer autoencoder. Input Set: recipes_normalized_varFS.csv. Output Size: (61880, 1000)
